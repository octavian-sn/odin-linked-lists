# Linked Lists & Recursion projects

[Linked Lists assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists)

[Recursion assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)

In the curriculum these two projects are separated in terms of git repositories, but I merged them into one for convenience and time saving purposes.

In the Linked Lists project we were supposed to create a linked list using either classes or factory functions. I chose factory functions over classes because I wanted to practice them in order to better understand the syntax.
Note: When creating certain methods, I thought it would be a great idea to reuse some of the previous methods, such as the case of *pop()*.

In Recursion we were supposed to create two functions that would output an array containing n fibonacci numbers, one using iteration and the second using recursive functions, and then a function that would sort an array using a recursive merge sort methodology.
